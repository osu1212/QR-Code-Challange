## My process
I began by adding the image of the QR code and the text under it, had issues fixing the gap between lines but later sorted it out. The next issue was adding the background colors,the came adding and fitting the border to the right dimensions and getting ever element to fit and for me this was the hardest part of this challange.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML tags
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

- [Styled Components]('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Outfit:wght@100..900&display=swap') 


### What I learned

For the HTML aspect, i learned how to import types from google fonts
```html
<style>
    @import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Outfit:wght@100..900&display=swap');
</style>
```

For the CSS, i learned how to create boarders with rounded edges, as well as fit and organize elements in them.
```css
.container {
    width: 200px;
    height: 320px;
    padding: 30px;
    padding-top: 10px;
    padding-left: 10px;
    padding-right: 10px;
    padding-bottom: 35px;
    border-radius: 10px;
    background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    flex-direction: column;
    overflow: hidden;
    margin: 5px auto;
}
```


### Continued development

I would love to build on my frontend skills especislly in the aspect of building user interactive web pages with javascript.
